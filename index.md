## About Me

I am currently a Research Associate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford from August 2021. I work in the Cyber-Physical Systems Group under the supervision of [Prof. Niki Trigoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_Trigoni) and [Prof. Andrew Markham](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.markham/). Prior to Oxford, I obtained his PhD degree in 2021 from China and was supervised by Prof. Jun Wang. In 2019, I went to Cardiff University, UK, as a joint PhD for 18 months in the School of Computer Science and Informatics, under the supervision of Prof. Yu-kun Lai and Jing Wu. **I aim to create intelligent systems for effective and efficient perception and understanding 3D scenes as my research objective.** My research interests are 3D Vision, Point Cloud Processing, and Scene Understanding, and publishes extensively in venues and journals such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, RA-L, TMM, IJCV, and etc. My research goal is to build intelligent systems which are able to achieve an effective and efficient perception and understanding of 3D scenes. **At Oxford, my current research focuses on human point cloud generation from multiple sensors.**
